The Tektronix 2400-series analog oscilloscopes are arguably the best portable analog scopes
ever built.
I have two scopes from the series, a [2465](https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/2465) and a
[2467](https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/2467), the latter of which is my favorite for
general spelunking.
The 2467 has the counter-timer (CTT) option, which is quite handy, as it provides a counter and
all kinds of timing functions.
Unfortunately there is a bug in the firmware, whereby the on-screen display brightness seems to
go to max whenever I bring up the CTT menu.

At one point, I decided to try and disassemble the firmware ROMs.
Perhaps Iâ€™d be able to find and fix the bug, as it seems Tektronix is no longer accepting bug
reports or user complaints for these scopes.

This has turned into a bit of an odyssey, and this site exists to document some of my travails.
Perhaps you will find it useful, or if not, at least amusing.
